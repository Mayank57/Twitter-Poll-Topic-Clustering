# Twitter-Poll-Topic-Clustering

We prepare an automated algorithm that can
classify Twitter polls based on their topic or
subject matter, and comparing the relevance of
certain topics in public discourse. This could
allow us to determine the level of relevance of
certain topics in public discourse and see how
these patterns change over time for different
topics
